/**
 * Represents a single sensor measurement, such as an on/off state, temperature or light value.
 * 
 * This class holds all information and metadata about this measurement and contains the logic to determine whether and when the data was last
 * updated, whether it should be published over MQTT etc.

        /**
         * Parameters:
         * - id: used to identify the measurement. Keep the id fairly short and concise.
         * - description: human readable description of the measurement. Displayed in the web interface.
         * - unit: unit of the measurement. E.g. "Â°C", "lux", or just an empty string. Displayed in the web interface.
         * - mqttTopic: path of the MQTT topic to publish the value of the measurement. E.g. "sensors/temperature". When NULL, the measurement
         *              will not be published.
         * - minPublishInterval: determines the time interval that the value must be published 'at minimum'. If the value hasn't changed for some
         *                       time, this parameter may trigger additional publishes of the last recorded value. E.g. if set to 3600000ms (1 hour),
         *                       the value will be published at least each hour if the value doesn't change. If the value does change, it will be
         *                       published more often. Value in milliseconds. If set to 0, the parameter is ignored.
         * - maxPublishInterval: determines the time interval that the value is allowed to be published 'at maximum'. If a measurement changes very
         *                       often, this parameter is used to limit the amount of times the value is published. E.g. if set to 1000ms, the value
         *                       will be published at maximum each second if the measurement changes more often than that. If the measurement changes 
         *                       less often though, it will be published only when it has changed.
